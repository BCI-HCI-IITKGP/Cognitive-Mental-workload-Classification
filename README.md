*Feature Extraction and Classification of Cognitive Mental workload EEG signals

This repository contains a Ipython notebook file which contains a module to extract features from EEG signals. These features can be used to train machine learning algorithms. 

Steps:

1. Download the Cognitive-Mental-workload-EEG-Data

2. Open the file Feature Extraction.ipynb

3. Run all the code in the notebook.

Note: Wait for a while after the code snippet with heading "Creating the feature vectors" is run to let the features get populated before normalizing the features. 

4. Then use these normalized features to train differnt classifiers in classification.ipynb
